/**
 * Boot-time check that the database actually has the schema this build expects.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-23 a deploy shipped code that reads
 * `users."lastLoginAt"` before the additive SQL in `docs/sql/` had been applied.
 * Nothing noticed at boot. The first person to sign in got
 * `/login/?error=callback_failed`, and every authenticated request 500'd, because
 * `authenticateUser` reads the same row — a full auth outage discovered by a user
 * rather than by the deploy. The pull request said in bold to apply the SQL
 * first; a warning in a description is not a gate, which is the whole point of
 * this file.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS. Every model in the Prisma client, by asking Postgres directly
 * whether the table and each of its columns exist. It is derived from the client
 * rather than from a hand-kept list, because a hand-kept list of "things to
 * check" goes stale in exactly the direction that hurts: someone adds a column,
 * forgets the list, and the check keeps reporting success over something it
 * cannot see. This codebase has been bitten by that shape repeatedly.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES ABOUT IT. Missing objects are fatal: the process logs what is
 * missing, which file creates it, and exits non-zero. A broken deploy should be
 * visibly broken at boot, not silently half-working — and exiting also stops the
 * retention scheduler, which deletes accounts, from ever running against a
 * half-migrated database.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not treat an unreachable database as
 * a schema failure. The server has always started without one (the static site
 * serves fine, individual requests fail), and exiting on a connection blip would
 * turn a transient upstream problem into a restart loop. Unreachable is a loud
 * warning; reachable-but-wrong is fatal. Distinguishing those two is most of the
 * value here.
