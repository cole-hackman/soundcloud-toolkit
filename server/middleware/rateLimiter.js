/**
 * Per-USER limiter, as opposed to every limiter above it, which is per-IP.
 *
 * Feedback is login-required, so the account is the thing worth budgeting:
 * per-IP would let one person on a phone and a laptop spend two budgets, and
 * would make a shared office NAT share one. The key is `req.user.id`, which
 * only exists because these limiters are always mounted AFTER
 * `authenticateUser` — mount one in front of it and every request keys on the
 * `req.ip` fallback instead, silently turning it back into a per-IP limiter.
 *
 * `validate.keyGeneratorIpFallback: false` switches off express-rate-limit v8's
 * guard against custom key generators that touch `req.ip` without the
 * `ipKeyGenerator` helper. The guard exists because an IPv6 user with a /64 can
 * rotate addresses to buy a fresh budget. That is accepted here: the fallback
 * is unreachable on the routes these limiters are mounted on, and anyone who
 * did reach it would be unauthenticated and have nothing to spend the budget
 * on. Left on, the guard dumps an ERR_ERL_KEY_GEN_IPV6 error to the console
 * every time the module loads — it does not throw, so the flag buys a clean
 * startup and an explicit record of the trade-off rather than a fixed crash.
