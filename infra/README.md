# Azure infrastructure

Everything Track Toolkit needs on Azure, as code. `docs/internal/MIGRATION.md` at the repo
root holds the decisions, verification log and open items; this file is the
operator's quick reference.

| Resource | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Resource group | `rg-tracktoolkit` | `westus3` (westus2 had no Burstable Postgres capacity for this subscription) |
| App Service plan | `tracktoolkit-plan` | Linux B1, **capacity 1, pinned** (see `main.bicep` comment and `server/lib/social-cache.js`) |
| Web app | `tracktoolkit` | `https://tracktoolkit.azurewebsites.net`, Node 22 LTS, `node server/index.js`, health check `/health` |
| Postgres | `tracktoolkit-pg` | Flexible Server, PG 17, Burstable B1ms, 32 GB, 7-day backups |
| Databases | `tracktoolkit`, `tracktoolkit-rehearsal` | prod-to-be (empty until cutover) and the throwaway rehearsal target |
| Key Vault | `tracktoolkit-kv` | RBAC mode; the web app reads secrets by reference |
| Log Analytics | `tracktoolkit-logs` | console, HTTP, app and platform logs, 30-day retention |

## Deploy or update the infrastructure

```bash
# First time: pick a strong password; it is stored in Key Vault as postgres-admin-password.
TT_PG_ADMIN_PASSWORD='...' infra/deploy.sh
# Later runs: read it back rather than inventing a new one.
TT_PG_ADMIN_PASSWORD="$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name tracktoolkit-kv --name postgres-admin-password --query value -o tsv)" infra/deploy.sh
```

Optional environment: `TT_CLIENT_IP` (adds a Postgres firewall rule for your
workstation), `TT_SECRET_*` (writes the matching Key Vault secret; see the
header of `deploy.sh` for the full list).

## Deploy the application

`.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`, run manually from the Actions tab (or
`gh workflow run azure-deploy.yml --ref <branch>`). It builds on Linux so the
Prisma engine matches the App Service image, runs the Jest suite, builds the
Next.js static export, and ships one zip. Oryx is disabled on the app
(`SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=false`), so what the workflow zips is exactly
what runs.

One-time setup for the workflow (already done for this repo, recorded here so
it can be rebuilt): an Entra app registration with a federated credential
whose subject is `repo:cole-hackman@83625748/tracktoolkit@1053639544:environment:azure` (GitHub now issues the subject with the owner and repository ids embedded, so it survives renames), the
`Website Contributor` role on `rg-tracktoolkit`, and the repository variables
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.

## Custom domains

Bindings are declared by the `customHostnames` parameter and stay empty until
DNS points at the app; Azure verifies ownership at bind time and fails
otherwise. Cutover order, per hostname:

1. DNS: `CNAME <host> tracktoolkit.azurewebsites.net` (apex: A record to the
   app's inbound IP plus `TXT asuid.<host> <verification id>`; the id is
   `az webapp show -n tracktoolkit -g rg-tracktoolkit --query customDomainVerificationId`).
2. Redeploy with the hostname in `customHostnames`.
3. `az webapp config ssl create -n tracktoolkit -g rg-tracktoolkit --hostname <host>`
   then `az webapp config ssl bind ... --ssl-type SNI` for the managed cert.

The retired `soundcloudtoolkit.com` hostnames are bound to the same app; the
301 is answered by Express (`LEGACY_REDIRECT_HOSTS`) rather than a separate
Front Door profile, which would cost more per month than the whole app.
