/**
 * The sidebar navigation tree — the single source of truth for "what tools
 * exist and what are they called".
 *
 * This list used to live inside `AppShell.tsx`. It moved here because more
 * than the sidebar needs it: the feedback form resolves a `?from=` pathname
 * to a human tool name, and importing the shell component just to read an
 * array would drag the whole sidebar (and its auth/theme context hooks) into
 * any page that asked. `AppShell` imports `NAV` back from here, so there is
 * still exactly one list.
 *
 * Keep it a plain `.ts` module: icons are referenced as components, never
 * rendered here, so nothing in this file needs JSX.
