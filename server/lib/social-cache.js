/**
 * When each (user, resource) was last invalidated: `{ rev, at }`.
 *
 * `cancelInFlight` only reaches loads registered in `inFlightLoads`. That left
 * three ways for a crawl that started before a mutation to publish its
 * pre-mutation snapshot afterwards: the persistent write in
 * loadUserCollection's tier 3, the background revalidate (which is not in
 * `inFlightLoads` at all), and a read racing the not-yet-committed
 * `status='invalidated'` UPDATE.
 *
 * The mark closes all three WITHIN THIS PROCESS, and does it synchronously —
 * no waiting on the database. A crawl records the mark when it starts and
 * refuses to publish if the mark has moved; a reader refuses a snapshot synced
 * at or before the mark.
 *
 * It is per-process state. At `instance_count > 1` (.do/app.yaml) a second
 * instance has an empty map: a crawl there that straddles a mutation made here
 * passes its own mark check and republishes the pre-mutation items as
 * `complete`, with a `syncedAt` newer than this instance's invalidation —
 * which then defeats this instance's reader guard too. The durable tier makes
 * that worse than the old in-memory cache, because the row looks
 * authoritative. Closing it across instances needs the mark persisted (a
 * revision column on library_cache_states); until then instance_count is the
 * gate. See CLAUDE.md, Known Limitations #6.
 *
 * Two different values, because the two comparisons want different things:
 *
 *   - `rev` is a process-wide counter that strictly increases on EVERY
 *     invalidation. `Date.now()` does not: two mutations inside the same
 *     millisecond produce the same timestamp, so a crawl that started between
 *     them would compare equal to the later one and publish pre-mutation data.
 *     Equality against a counter cannot collide that way.
 *   - `at` is the wall clock, compared against `syncedAt`. BOTH sides come from
 *     this process's clock: writeSnapshot stamps `syncedAt` with `new Date()`
 *     in Node, not with a database default, and that is what makes the
 *     comparison sound. Do not move `syncedAt` to a Postgres-side now() —
 *     Node/Postgres skew of tens of milliseconds would silently break the only
 *     guard covering the uncommitted-invalidation window.
 *
 * Bounded like the sibling caches (request-cache DEFAULT_MAX_ENTRIES,
 * auth-cache MAX_ENTRIES): an uncapped map keyed by user is a leak scaled by
 * distinct users, and entries are also dropped on account deletion. The cap is
 * generous on purpose. An evicted mark reads as 0, which makes an in-flight
 * crawl refuse to publish (safe) but lets a reader serve a snapshot during the
 * milliseconds before invalidateSnapshot's UPDATE commits (not safe). Eviction
 * only bites if that many OTHER (user, resource) pairs invalidate inside that
 * window, so the number just has to be far above plausible concurrency.
