              <p>
                Your security and privacy are our top priorities. SC Toolkit
                uses official SoundCloud OAuth authentication, which means we
                never see or store your password. All access tokens are
                encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption. We only request
                the minimum permissions needed to manage your playlists, and you
                can revoke access at any time through your SoundCloud settings.

                Limitations
              </h2>
              <p>
                SoundCloud has a limit of 500 tracks per playlist. When merging
                playlists or creating new ones, we automatically cap results at
                this limit and remove duplicates to ensure your playlists are
                valid. This is a SoundCloud platform limitation, not a
                limitation of our tools.
