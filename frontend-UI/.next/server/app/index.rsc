We provide powerful playlist management tools at no cost to help you organize your SoundCloud music. There are no hidden fees, premium tiers, or subscription requirements."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How secure is my SoundCloud account?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your account security is our top priority. We use official SoundCloud OAuth authentication, which means we never see or store your password. We only request the minimum permissions needed to manage your playlists, and all tokens are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I merge playlists with more than 500 tracks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"SoundCloud has a limit of 500 tracks per playlist. When merging playlists, we automatically cap the result at 500 tracks and remove duplicates to ensure your merged playlist is valid. If you have more tracks, we'll include the first 500 unique tracks."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens to my original playlists?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your original playlists remain completely untouched. When you merge playlists or create new ones from your likes, we create new playlists rather than modifying existing ones. You have full control over your music library."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I undo changes made to my playlists?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"When using the Playlist Modifier, you can undo the last applied order. However, we recommend being careful with playlist modifications as SoundCloud doesn't provide a built-in undo feature. Always review changes before saving."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does SC Toolkit work with private playlists?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, SC Toolkit works with both public and private playlists. As long as you have access to the playlists through your SoundCloud account, you can use all our tools to organize them."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does SC Toolkit handle duplicate tracks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our smart deduplication system identifies duplicate tracks across your playlists by comparing track IDs, titles, and artists. When merging playlists or cleaning up your library, duplicates are automatically detected and you can choose to remove them with a single click."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is SC Toolkit affiliated with SoundCloud?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, SC Toolkit is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to SoundCloud. This is an independent tool created to enhance the SoundCloud user experience. We use SoundCloud's official public API with proper OAuth authentication."}}]}0:{"P":null,"b":"-eHtB3w63_-4WvJg2UqBg","p":"","c":["",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/abbc43cbf27100e9.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","className":"__variable_f367f3","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","link",null,{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://www.soundcloudtoolkit.com/"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"theme-color","content":"#FF5500"}]]}],["$","body",null,{"className":"antialiased font-sans","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"children":["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}],["$","$L5",null,{}],["$","$L6",null,{}]]}]]}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"SC Toolkit\",\"url\":\"https://www.soundcloudtoolkit.com\",\"logo\":\"https://www.soundcloudtoolkit.com/SC%20Toolkit%20Icon.png\",\"description\":\"SC Toolkit helps SoundCloud power users organize, merge, and clean playlists.\",\"sameAs\":[]}"}}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"SoftwareApplication\",\"name\":\"SC Toolkit\",\"applicationCategory\":\"MusicApplication\",\"operatingSystem\":\"Web\",\"description\":\"Powerful playlist management tools for SoundCloud.
